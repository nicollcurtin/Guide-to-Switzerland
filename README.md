# Entertainment

Zurich has a wide array of attractions on offer, from museums and theatres, to parks and nightlife. We’ve compiled just a few of our favourites below.

<b>Hop On A Boat</b><br>
If you’re looking to explore the city, why not do it in style? Fun, practical, and comfortable, it’s hard to think of a better way to discover the beauty of Zurich.
<br><br><b>Head Up to Uetliberg</b><br>
Treat yourself to some mountaintop relaxation, just 15 minutes by rail from the main station. Once you’re at the top, soak up picturesque views in every direction, or kick back with a drink in the Restaurant Uto Kulm. 
<b><br><br>Explore Zurich West</b><br>
Home to shops, bars, restaurants and the Viaduct, Zurich West is the heart of the city, and definitely not a spot you want to miss. 
<b><br><br>Cycle</b><br>
Cycle from site to site - for free! Just leave a CHF 20 deposit at one of the Züri rollt containers, and you’re off. Daily 8.00am – 9.30pm. 
<b><br><br>Take a Tram</b><br>
Trams in Zurich are more than mere transportation; they’re an experience in themselves. There are a whole range of special trams offering dinner and drinks – check out the sushi tram, the fondue tram, or the apéro tram. 
<b><br><br>Museums and Galleries</b><br>
If you’re a culture lover, you’re in the right place – Zurich offers more than 60 museums and over 100 galleries.  Below are just a handful of our favourites:

<b><br><br>Nightlife</b><br>
Nightlife in Zurich is nothing if not lively. Surrounded with bars and nightclubs, it’s not hard to find a place to party, whether you’re into rock, pop or hip-hop.
<b><br><br>Shopping</b><br>
Zurich is well-known for being a shopping city. Bahnhofstrasse is famous for being one of the most exclusive shopping streets in the world, and Niederdorf and the Sihlcity shopping centre are also good spots. Shop until you drop, but keep in mind that (except for the train station stores) all shops are closed on Sundays.
<b><br><br>Cinemas</b><br>
It’s not difficult to find movies in English, however most films have subtitles in the three official languages of Switzerland: German, French and Italian.
